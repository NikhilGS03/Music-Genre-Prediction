# Music-Genre-Prediction

The **Music Genre Prediction** is an intelligent system designed to classify songs into different genres based on their audio features. This system leverages machine learning techniques to analyze various attributes of music, such as tempo, pitch, and rhythm, and accurately predicts the genre. The primary goal is to provide an automated solution for organizing large music libraries and enhancing music recommendation systems.

It uses a trained model, developed using provided training and testing datasets, to predict the genre of each song. The system also derives an accuracy score to evaluate model performance. Additionally, another dataset containing label numbers and IDs is used for validation and mapping purposes. Visualizations are included to help users understand feature importance and model effectiveness.

Particularly beneficial for music streaming services, DJs, and music enthusiasts who need to categorize music efficiently. By automating the genre classification process, it saves time and effort while maintaining a high level of accuracy, making it an invaluable tool for anyone dealing with large collections of music.
